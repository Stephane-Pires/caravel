# Notes on "Peopleware" by "Tom DeMarco"

## Human resources

- Projects fails to due sociological reason, not due to technical reason

- Knowledge base work is fondamentaly different from production work in that :

  - People enjoy their work

  - Pressure on people will make them work faster, not better. In the long run it's an issue

  - You should allow a buffer for errors, people learn from errors that whats makes them better in the long run.

- Overtime is always followed by an equivalent or more important downtime. People need to catch up with their life at a moment or another.

- Don't reason in a fixed 40 hours work week. Since we are in a knowledge base work, people might work or think about work OUTSIDE of work.

- If you push for quality, (not market quality but worker quality) people are more motivated to work harder.

- The authors give examples of the Japanese industry and 80's Hewlett-Packard. We could also think about the Blizzard slogan during the 20's "Release it when it's ready" [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WC3/comments/ewecxn/blizzard_used_to_say_well_release_it_when_its/)

- If you are commited to quality, you give the power to the worker to veto if a feature hasn't meet the standard for quality

- According the the author, the Parkinson law that state "Work complicates to fill the available time" isn't verfied by data.

- According to the book, the best productivity is achived when the project is not estimated

- The authors conclude this part with "The manager function is not to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work". In the regard the classical role of "Scrumaster" fits to that definition

## The office Environment

- People might work better with natural light and low noise level

- By optimising space inside workspace, you might be losing efficiency of worker. The ratio is around 20:1

- $$
   Ratio\ = \frac{ worker\ efficiency}{ space\ saving} = 20:1
  $$

- Don't interupt people, your losing in efficiency.

- Their might be a ratio in productivity of 10:1. Between the best developers/organisation and the worst

- People work best when they enter the "Flow" it's a state of deep focus where people lose the sens of time. You need calm and concentration to enter that state of mind

- $$
  E\ factor\ = \frac{ Uninterrupted\ Hours}{ Body\ Present\ Hours}
  $$

- If you can use a Asynchrone way of communicating it might be more efficent **call** ðŸ˜ˆ VS **mail** ðŸ˜‡

- The author state that it's more complicated than that, relying only on asynchonous communication and mail could be harmful. From my experience, relying only on asynchronous communication canal, is harmful especially during long period of remote working (Covid ðŸ˜·)

- Having a door is nice
