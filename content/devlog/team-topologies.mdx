# Notes on "Team Topologies" by "Matthew skelton" & "Manuel Pais"

## Teams as the mean to delivery

### The problem with org charts

- Org charts doesn't reflect the real communication structure.

- Search for teams that aren't related to each other but communicate

- You should align your teams structure with the software architecture structure

- Multiple quotes of the Conway law.

### Conway's law and why it matters

- If software system reflect the way people communicate, then we should design the teams scope and responsabilites to reflect the software Architecture we want

- When designing the teams you should have IT experts with you

- You should be looking for high communication inside teams, low to no communication between teams

- Antipattern : everyone communicating with (or knowing about) everyone

- If two teams are coupled/paired, then they should reach for similar tools (IT). Otherwise you shouldn't impose the same tools to everyone
