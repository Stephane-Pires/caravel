# Notes on "Team Topologies" by "Matthew skelton" & "Manuel Pais"

## Teams as the mean to delivery

### The problem with org charts

- Org charts doesn't reflect the real communication structure.

- Search for teams that aren't related to each other but communicate

- You should align your teams structure with the software architecture structure

- Multiple quotes of the Conway law.

### Conway's law and why it matters

- If software system reflect the way people communicate, then we should design the teams scope and responsabilites to reflect the software Architecture we want

- When designing the teams you should have IT experts with you

- You should be looking for high communication inside teams, low to no communication between teams

- Antipattern : everyone communicating with (or knowing about) everyone

- If two teams are coupled/paired, then they should reach for similar tools (IT). Otherwise you shouldn't impose the same tools to everyone

### Team First Thinking

- You should think in term of teams, when assigning work you assign it to teams not to people

- Teams should be small and long lived, you don't disband teams that work well

- Teams should not be more than 5 - 8 peoples, exceptionnaly in high trust organisation they go up to 15 peoples

- The team owns the software, so there is no shared repository [The tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons)

- Tools shouldn't be imposed to the team

- You should work with a teams first mindset. The goal of the team is more important than the goal of peoples composing it

- You should not make compromise on "Team first" approach

- Studies have shown that diversity in teams help creativity

- Since the smallest work unit in the company is the team. You should reward the team, not the individual

- People come and go, the team stays

- Restrict team responsabilities to match team cognitive load

- Cognitive load is coupled to domain complexity

- Teams should have dedicated space and time to share and learn things

- Your teams should use fondamental engineering practices : CI - CD - Lean UX - TDD - Etc..

#### Dunbar numbers

- Your organisation group size should respect dunbar numbers

#### Build a Team "API"

- Code produced by the team

- Versionning log of the team Code

- Wiki and Documentation for the team (not for the whole company !!)

- Practices and principales the way the team work

- Communication guidelines

- Work information

- Etc...

## Team topologies that work for flow

### Static team topologies

- Teams should be form around domain problem

- A Team should have ownership of her domain from DEV to LIVE

- DevOps helps teams to put code into production, and monitor whats happening on live

- A feature team, is a team who has ownership on the "feature" from specification to production and monitoring. Team members need a high engineering maturity and trust.

- A feature team shouldn't have depenciencies to other teams

- A product is like a feature team but for all features of a production

#### Team antipattern

- Team adhoc, that respond to a production issue, for example : A database crash, then you create a database team to respond to this issue

- Teams with a short lifespan
