- [Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events)

### Network

### Caches policies

- [cache-control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control)

### Web Vitals

- [WebVitals](https://web.dev/vitals/)
- [Measuring performance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Performance/Measuring_performance)

- Browser centric metrics (Load Page, TTFB) VS User centric metrics (FCP, LCP, CLS, FIP)

- TTI (TimeToInteractive) : The time it takes for a user to have a first interaction, times between the content loading (HTTP - REQUEST/RESPONSE) + time it takes to the browser to paint (DOM + HTML + CSS) and make interactive the page (JS)

- TTFB (Time To First Byte) : Time for the client to receive the first byte of data from the network

- FCP (First contentful paint) : Time it takes for the browser to render the first element after a navigation

- LCP (Largest content paint) : Time it takes to load and render the main page content

- CLS (Cumulative Layout shift) : Measure visual stability to avoid layout/element shift

- FID (First Input Delay) : Times between the user interaction and the event + handler being treated by javascript

- INP (Interaction next paint) : [link](https://web.dev/inp/)

- Latency : Time between a packet is sent and when it is received in (ms)

- Speed index % : How much of the final rendering was happend at each point of a timeline

- RUM (Real User Metrics) : The metrics of the users, opposed to labs metrics

### Frontend Security :

- XSS : Inject some malicous script, that will get executed on target clients. [Owasp XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)

- CSRF : Get the credentials of site to fake a user [CSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)

- UI Redressing : Make an invisible button when the user click somewhere he clicks on the invisible button [Clickjacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking)

- (M)an (I)n (T)he (M)iddle : Someone intercept the communication between two endpoint [Man in the middle](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attaque_de_l%27homme_du_milieu)

### Image Format :

- PNG : Transparency, heavy format, lossless compression

- JPEG : Lossy compression, support progressive rendering

- WebP : Transparency + progressive rendering, better algo (Lossy & Lossless modes)

- Avif : HDR + Transparency
