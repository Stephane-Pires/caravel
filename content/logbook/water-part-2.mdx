# Water: Part 2 - Small water cycle

This article is part of a series of articles on the theme of water.

## Steps

The small water cycle is an artificial cycle made by us (humans) to manage water in our own convinience.
The key part a small water cycle are :

- Captation
- Cleaning
- Distribution
- Stockage
- Usage
- Collection
- Cleaning
- Releasing

Let's take an an example, when you brush your teeth ðŸª¥.

Water need to be taken from a natural source, this is the **captation**.
Then, we need to control the quality of the water, depending of the quality the water might need further **cleaning**.
After that, we need to **distribute** the water on the network (the pipes).
Then, we need might need to **stock** the water in a tank or a reservoir to be sure you get water to brush your teeth at the right time. Since we are not capting and distributing water continiously.
The next step is to use brush your teeth, you are **using** it.
Once used it goes through the sink, which is a different network of pipes than the potable water network, we are **collecting** the used water.
Of course we are not going to release the water has it is, we are going to **clean** it so water is not polluted for others.
Finaly we are **releasing** the water in the environment, so that others might capt it again for their own usage
