# Review of "Mythical Man Month" by **Fred Brooks**

## Personal Notes

The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering is a book on software engineering and project management by Fred Brooks first published in 1975, with subsequent editions in 1982 and 1995. Its central theme is that adding manpower to a software project that is behind schedule delays it even longer. This idea is known as Brooks's law, and is presented along with the second-system effect and advocacy of prototyping.

### Software management by the Time prism

<Quote

- Software is hard to estimate because people are optimitic in their estimate.
- We should consider the worst case scenario
- Half of the time (at least) is spent on testing
- There is a non trivial cost when adding manpower to a software. You take times from productive people.

### Protect the "Conceptual integrity" of the software

- The overall architecture of a software should comes from few mind
- You should document your architecture choices
- You should constrain your system
- Local optimum shouldn't challenge the whole integrity of the software.

### Communication problem

<Quote
  author="Conway's law"
  quote="Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure."
/>

{/* - Number of communication canal = n(n+1)/2. N is the number of people in a team. */}

- As the team grows the number of communication canal grow too.

$$
Number\ of\ canal = \frac{n\ (n+1)}{2}
$$

- One way to address this problem is to split teams, and interface them by managers.

### Teams

- Senior technical & managerial man (the surgon)
- Diverse people (stacking people with similar skills won't work)
- Relatively small around or less than 10 people

### Gouvernance

- Since software projects are knowledge and experience based they tend to be either directed by "Aristocracy" or "Democratie"

### Second system effect

- The architect on his first design will not anticipate issues but respond to them.
- On his second design, due to his first experience the architect might overthink the second system

### Documents

- In their essence documents should answer to "What, When, How much, Where, Who"
- The Architectural choices should be documented and versionned
- Documents are a way to formalize the intention

### Entropy

- As the time pass the entropy of a project grows.
- It grows to the point where moving one step forward makes you move two step backward.

### High level language & compiler

- Using a high level language upgrade the productivity reduce, reducing the number of lines wrotes.
- Compiler catch bugs and optimitize.
- I think, in some extend the same logic could be applied to GPT trend, it's a new tool that will reduce friction between the "WHAT" and the "HOW" to do something

## Key take-aways

- Beware time estimation, in your estimate think about the testing that it implies

- TODO TEST 1

- TODO TEST 2
