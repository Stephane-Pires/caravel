# What is functionnal programming ?

- Side effect : Is "something", that the function modify, that is not part the return value of the function

- Pure function : Pure function are function that can with the same inputs give the same outputs. It has no side effects

- Immutability : Data is immutable if you can't change it. In functional programming having immutable data protects from side effects

- Deterministic: A pure function is deterministic, that mean for a same input, it gives the same outputs

- Procedure function : A procedure is "function" that has side effect.

Example :

```ts
// multiply is pure
function multiply(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x * y
}
// Same inputs give same outputs at each function execution
multiply(1, 3) // 3
multiply(1, 3) // 3

let a: number = 1

// add is impure, it has a side effect, therefore it's a procedure
function add(x: number): number {
  a = x + a
  return a
}

add(3) // 4
add(3) // 7
```

- Arity : A function arity is the number of parameter a function has

- Unary : A unary function is a function with only one parameter. So his arity is 1

Example :

```ts
// addOne is a unary function
function addOne(x: number): number {
  return x + 1
}

addOne(1) // 2
```

- Higher order functions : Are functions that takes other functions has inputs

Example:

```ts
function filter<T>(
  predicate: (value: T) => boolean,
  array: Array<T>
): Array<T> {
  if (array.length === 0) return []

  const [head, ...tail] = array

  const filtered = predicate(head) ? [head] : []

  return filtered.concat(filter(predicate, tail))
}
```

```ts
function map<T, U>(applyFunction: (value: T) => U, array: Array<T>): Array<U> {
  if (array.length === 0) return []

  const [head, ...tail] = array

  return [applyFunction(head)].concat(map(applyFunction, tail))
}
```

```ts
function reduce<T, U>(
  accumulator: U,
  applyFunction: (accumulator: U, value: T) => U,
  array: Array<T>
): U {
  if (array.length === 0) return accumulator

  let [head, ...tails] = array

  return reduce(applyFunction(accumulator, head), applyFunction, tails)
}
```

- Composition : You compose function when the output of a function is the input of another function

Example :

```ts
const pokemons = ["pikachu", "pichu", "tortank", "carapuce", "salameche"]

function toLength(string: string) {
  return string.length
}

function aboveSeven(number: number) {
  return number > 7
}

pokemons.map(toLength).filter(aboveSeven)
```

- Referential transparency : You achieve referencial transparency if you can take a function call and replace it with it's evaluated values, and it doesn't break your code

- Point free : You have a point free composition, when you don't specify the arguments of the functions you compose with.

For exemple :

```ts
const addTwentyTwo = (x: number) => x + 22
const substractThree = (x: number) => x - 3

// result = 19
const result = [addTwentyTwo, substractThree].reduce(
  (acc, func) => func(acc),
  0
)
```

# Functional programming optimization

# Functional programming patterns

## Currying

- Currying is the transformation of a function with multiple parameters in a composition of multiple unary function

Example:

```ts
function quote(author: string, year: number, text: string): string {
  return `The author ${author} in the year ${year} said : ${text}`
}

const curriedQuote = (author: string) => (year: number) => (text: string) =>
  quote(author, year, text)

// Theses function are partial application of quote
const frankHerbertQuote = curriedQuote("Frank Herbert")
const frankHerbertQuoteIn1964 = frankHerbertQuote(1964)
const frankHerbertQuoteIn1964FromDune = frankHerbertQuoteIn1964(
  "“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”"
)

console.log(frankHerbertQuoteIn1964FromDune)
// The author Frank Herbert in the year 1964 said : “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer.
// Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
// And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”'
```

## Partial application

- Partial application is the application of `n` parameter of a function. To transform a function of arity `x` to a new function of arity `x - n`.
